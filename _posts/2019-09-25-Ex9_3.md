title: Example 9.3 (Nise)
---

This is the 3rd post in my series on solving controller design problems from Nise [1]. This time we are going to design a pure derivative controller to meet a settling time requirement. The interesting part of this problem is how we used the settling time requirement to choose the controller zeroâ€™s location. 

### Example 9.3: Designing an Ideal Derivative Controller [1]

In this problem we are given a plant and told to design a derivative controller that reduces the settling time by a factor of 3. We are also told that the plant has 16% overshoot (we will assume this is fixed throughout the problem). The solution flow is:    
   
**(1)** Draw out the root locus.     
    
**(2)** Calculate the damping from the overshoot specification. Use the damping coefficient to find the closed loop pole locations.     
    
**(3)** Use the pole locations to solve for the uncompensated settling time of the system. Also calculate the desired compensated settling time (reduce by a factor of 3).    
   
**(4)** Choose the location of the new compensated closed loop poles by calculating real and imaginary components from the settling time requirement.    
   
**(5)** Use the sum of the phase contributions from all open loop poles and zeros to choose the position of the controller zero.
