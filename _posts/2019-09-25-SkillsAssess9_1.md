title: Skills Assessment 9.1 (Nise)

This is a bonus post! I wasn’t sure if I should share this solution too for fear of exhausting the reader, but I’d be curious to compare my solution with others. This is my solution to Nise’s Skills Assessment Problem 9.1 [1]. I’m not going to lay out a detailed explanation (please see my [post on designing lag compensators](https://sassafras13.github.io/Ex9_2/)) but my solution is shown below.
