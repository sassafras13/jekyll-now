title: Example 11.3 (Nise)
---

In this post I am going to walk through the lead compensator design process using Bode plots. This question is drawn from Niseâ€™s Example 11.3 [1]. The objective of this question is to design a lead compensator for the plant shown below. The design requirements are:    

**(1)** 20% overshoot    
**(2)** Steady state velocity error constant = 40     
**(3)** Peak time of 0.1 seconds      

The design process is shown below.
