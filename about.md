Welcome to my website! I am a mechanical engineer and graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by the [Microsystems and Mechanobiology Lab](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/bex/news/) and the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php/). My research is in building microswimmers which have potential uses in medicine, biology and chemistry. Sometimes I [post on Medium](https://medium.com/@benjaminsonemma9) as well. (I do not make money from my posts, and if you cannot access one of my articles because of Medium's paywall, please e-mail me and I will send you a copy.)

You can read my old website [here](http://benjaminsonemma9.wixsite.com/starshiptoadventure/). It was fun to write but I prefer using Github and Jekyll, instead of Wix.
